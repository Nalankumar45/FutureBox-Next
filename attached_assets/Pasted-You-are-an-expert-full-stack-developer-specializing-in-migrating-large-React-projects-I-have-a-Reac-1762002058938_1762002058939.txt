You are an expert full-stack developer specializing in migrating large React projects.
I have a React project built using Vite + JavaScript/TypeScript, and I want to convert it to Next.js (with TypeScript).

Please perform the migration without changing any existing design, UI, or functionality — only modify structure and syntax as needed for Next.js compatibility.

Here are the detailed requirements 👇

🧩 1️⃣ Conversion Goal

Convert my entire Vite React app to Next.js 14+ with TypeScript (App Router).

Keep all pages, components, hooks, and styles exactly the same visually and functionally.

Maintain folder organization as much as possible.

🧱 2️⃣ Structural Changes

Replace Vite setup (vite.config.ts, index.html, etc.) with Next.js conventions:

Create a next.config.js or next.config.mjs

Add a tsconfig.json with proper "paths" if needed

Move main routes into the app/ directory (App Router)

Replace main.tsx / index.tsx with app/layout.tsx and app/page.tsx

Move routing from React Router → Next.js file-based routing

⚙️ 3️⃣ Next.js Setup

Use these packages:

npm install next@latest react react-dom typescript @types/react @types/node


Add scripts:

"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start",
  "lint": "next lint"
}


Support Tailwind CSS and PostCSS (if used in the original project)

🎨 4️⃣ Design & Assets

Preserve all CSS, SCSS, Tailwind, or styled-components styles.

Keep the same public assets (images, fonts, icons) under /public/.

Ensure all imports to assets are updated to Next.js format (e.g., /images/...).

🔗 5️⃣ Functional Adjustments

Replace API calls or fetches with Next.js-compatible ones if using SSR/ISR.

Keep client-side behavior unchanged; only use "use client" where needed.

Use dynamic routes for any parameterized pages (e.g. [id]/page.tsx).

🧠 6️⃣ TypeScript & Aliases

Convert .jsx → .tsx where applicable.

Update tsconfig.json to include:

"compilerOptions": {
  "baseUrl": ".",
  "paths": { "@/*": ["./*"] }
}


Fix all import paths accordingly.

⚡ 7️⃣ Validation

After conversion:

The build should work with:

npm run dev
npm run build


There should be no visual or behavioral difference compared to the Vite version.

🧾 8️⃣ Output Expected

Folder structure of the new Next.js project

Updated code examples for layout.tsx, page.tsx, _app.tsx (if using Pages Router)

List of all updated or replaced files

Instructions on how to run and verify the migrated app

✨ Optional Enhancements

If possible, also:

Configure ESLint and Prettier for Next.js

Optimize image imports using next/image

Add metadata via app/layout.tsx

🧩 Files to pay special attention to:

main.tsx → Next.js entry point

App.tsx → layout.tsx + page.tsx

vite.config.ts → remove and replace with next.config.js

All react-router-dom routes → file-based routing
